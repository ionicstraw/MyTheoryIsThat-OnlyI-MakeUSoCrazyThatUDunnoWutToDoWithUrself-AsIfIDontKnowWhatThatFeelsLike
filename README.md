# MyTheoryIsThat-OnlyI-MakeUSoCrazyThatUDunnoWutToDoWithUrself-AsIfIDontKnowWhatThatFeelsLike

ill tell u a secret, actually i realized this throughout the week as i was thinking about this, admittedly, i was a little too shy to talk to you .. i was thinking like, oh yeah i wasnt saying too much bc i didnt want u to get in trouble, but i was a little too shy to respond to u, which is interesting to me bc im not a shy person, and ive really worked on that, im not afraid of public speaking, sometimes like maybe ill not remember the next thought sometimes that happens, but im really not, and in other interviews, like im fine im talking about things python or whatever, but u made me a little shy, thats not good i have to work on that

all this attitude ure going to experience one day, im not going to be a mute around you, i have to really work on this bc what if im all talk and im just like a non-responsive person around you thats not good
